# Learn Rholang By Example

This tutorial teaches the basics of rholang by example and experimentation.
The tutorials are meant to be run, read, modified and completed. For best
results, change anything and everything you are curious about.

This does not aim to be an exhaustive tour of everything there is to know about
rholang, but rather a tour of the most common and important features of the
language and a fast starting point for motivated learners. For more information
check out the official rholang documentation at: https://developer.rchain.coop/documentation

This project is originally based on my [Learn Python by Example](https://github.com/JoshOrndorff/LearnPythonByExample)
project

## Target Audience
This tutorial aims to be novice-friendly and introduce rholang from the ground
up. If you've never ever programmed before, you may struggle at times, but
if you know how to write a little python or javascript, you've got all the
background I've assumed.

At some point you may find it useful to listen to the epicenter podcast listed
first under "More Resources".

More background never hurts, and can only help, but I'm not expecting you to
be familiar with process calculi, be a mast of any other languages, or be
able to understand all the theoretical math discussed in the additional
resources.

## Development Environment

### Online Interpreter
The easiest way to get started is to use the [online rholang interpreter](http://rchain.cloud)

### Run locally
Eventually you'll want to run the code locally rather than through a web
interface. That can be done with a docker container or by installing natively.
At the moment, this isn't a very nice process, but will improve. I
plan to eventually write a meta-lesson about getting your development
environment setup.

## Getting started
To begin a lesson, run it and observe its output. See if you can figure out
why it runs the way it does, but if you can't don't worry.

After you have run a program observed its operation, open it in your
favorite text editor, or paste it into the online interpreter. The programs
are heavily commented to explain each line of code.

After reading through, and understanding the code, experiment by changing
anything and everything you like. Don't worry about breaking anything; that's
how you learn. You can always restore a previous version if you don't remember
how to undo your changes.

Complete the exercises at the bottom of each program to ensure you fully
understand the lesson. And finally, as you work through each unit, complete
the projects that accompany it.

## Questions and Individual Attention
Occasionally you may need additional help. You may contact me through
[my website](https://joshyorndorff.com/contact). In the future I plan to
make these lessons part of my laera project which incentive aligns teachers
and learners. I'd love to tell you more about it.
