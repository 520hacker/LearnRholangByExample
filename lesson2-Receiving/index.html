    <h1>Check for Messages</h1>

    <p>We learned last time how to send a message. Now it's time to learn how to receive a message. The general syntax is:</p>

    <p><code>for(message &lt;- channel){ // Do something here}</code></p>

    <p>BTW, lines that start with <code>//</code> are called comments. They're just there for human coders and don't affect the way the program runs at all. They're a good idea, and you should use them! Anyone who reads your code (including your future self) will appreciate them.</p>

  <div class="slide">
    <h1>Comm Events</h1>

    <figure class="right">
      <img src="pizza.png" />

        Pizza shop can receive messages on its channel.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The following code sends a message on a channel for a pizza shop and the pizza shop receives it. The pizza shop acknowledges receiving the message by printing to stdout.</p>

    include pizzaOrder.rho



  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h1>Your turn</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>Remember, in rholang things don't happen in order, they happen concurrently. The pizza shop code will work just as well if we put the receive first. Give it a try!</li>
      <li>Send that message to a different channel like <code>@"coffeShop"</code>. Did the acknowledgement print? Is anything left in the tuplespace?</li>
    </ul>

      <figure>
        <img src="coffee.png" />

          Let's hit up the coffee shop.

    <h1>Receiving Before Sending</h1>

    <figure class="left">
      <img src="lookingForMessages.png" />
      <figcaption>
        Rather than the message appearing first, then someone receiving it, Greg is trying to receive first. Hopefully someone will send him a message so he can get his comm on!
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>When a send and a receive come together on a channel, it is called a communication event, or "comm event" for short.</p>

    <p>Unlike normal mail where a message must be sent <em>then</em> received, the two can happen in either order or at the same time in rholang. It is just as cceptible to receive a message, then send it. Whenever a send and receive come together, a comm event takes place.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h1>Contracts</h1>

    <figure class="right">
      <img src="pizzaBurning.png" />
      <figcaption>
        The poor chef is too busy making sure he can receive orders to take care of his pizza.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Out pizza shop example illustrates comm events nicely, but it isn't very realistic to expect the pizza shop to manually issue a new receive every time an incoming order consumes theirs from the tuplespace.</p>

    <p>Luckily it's possible to deploy code once, and have it run <em>every</em> time it receives a message. This kind of thing is called a "smart contract". Let's look at some code for a coffee chop that is much superior to the pizza shop.</p>

    include coffeeshop.rho here
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h1>Your turn</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>Order another drink from the coffee shop</li>
      <li>Change the acknowledgement message</li>
      <li>The channel is just named <code>@"coffeeShop"</code>. Change it to be named after a specific coffee shop of your choosing.</li>
      <li>Write a similar contract for our pizzaShop. (You'll remember the syntax more if you write it yourself rather than copy-pasting.)</li>
    </ul>


  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h1>Persistant For</h1>
    <p>There are actually two different styles of syntax in rholang to acheive this persistent behavior. We just learned about <code>contract</code>. The other option is called a "persistent for". Here is another way to write the coffee shop code.</p>

    include PersistentCoffeeShop.rho

    <p>Notice this is different from a normal for because it has a double arrow <code>&lt;=</code> rather than a single arrow <code>&lt;-</code>. The only difference between the persistent for and a contract comes when we start talking about blockchains. For now you can think of them as the same thing.</p>

    <h1>Quiz</h1>

    <p>Which of these things is not like the other?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q1" id="q1a1" />
      <label for="q1a1">
        <code>for (a &lt;- b){}</code>
      </label><br />

      <input type="radio" name="q1" id="q1a2" />
      <label for="q1a2">
        <code>contract b(a) = {}</code>
      </label><br />

      <input type="radio" name="q1" id="q1a3" />
      <label for="q1a3">
        <code>for (a &lt;= b){}</code>
      </label><br />

    <p>Which send will produce a comm event with <code>for (message &lt;- @"grandmasSnapChat"){}</code>?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q2" id="q2a1" />
      <label for="q2a1"><code>
        grandmasSnapChat!("Hi Grandma")
      </code></label><br />

      <input type="radio" name="q2" id="q2a2" />
      <label for="q2a2"><code>
        @"grandmasSnapChat"!("Glad you're snapping Grandma")
      </code></label><br />

      <input type="radio" name="q2" id="q2a3" />
      <label for="q2a3"><code>
        for("Here's a snap for you g'ma" &lt;- @"grandmasSnapChat")
      </code></label><br />

    <p>Which should generally come first?</p>
      <input type="radio" name="q3" id="q3a1" />
      <label for="q3a1">A send because that's how normal mail works.</label><br />

      <input type="radio" name="q3" id="q3a2" />
      <label for="q3a2">A receive because it's faster to run the code that way.</label><br />

      <input type="radio" name="q3" id="q3a3" />
      <label for="q3a3">Either a send or a receive can come first, or they can come together.</label><br />

      <input type="radio" name="q3" id="q3a4" />
      <label for="q3a4">A receive because rholang is concurrent.</label><br />

      <input type="radio" name="q3" id="q3a5" />
      <label for="q3a5">Neither. Just make a comm event directly.</label><br />
