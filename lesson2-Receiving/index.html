    <h2>Check for Messages</h2>

    <p>We learned last time how to send a message. Now it's time to learn how to receive a message. The general syntax is:</p>

    <p><code>for(message &lt;- channel){ // Do something here}</code></p>

    <p>BTW, lines that start with <code>//</code> are called comments. They're just there for human coders and don't affect the way the program runs at all. They're a good idea, and you should use them! Anyone who reads your code (including your future self) will appreciate them.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h2>Comm Events</h2>

    <p>The following code sends a message on a channel for a pizza shop and the pizza shop receives it. The pizza shop acknowledges receiving the message by printing to stdout.</p>

    include pizzaOrder.rho



  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h2>Your turn</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Remember, in rholang things don't happen in order, they happen concurrently. The pizza shop code will work just as well if we put the receive first.</li>
      <li>Send that message to a different channel like <code>@"coffeShop"</code>. Did the acknowledgement print? Is anything left in the tuplespace?</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h2>Receiving Before Sending</h2>

    <p>When a send and a receive come together on a channel, it is called a communication event, or "comm event" for short.</p>

    <p>Unlike normal mail where a message must be sent <em>then</em> received, the two can happen in either order in rholang. It is just as cceptible to receive a message, then send it. Whenever a send and receive come together, a comm event takes place.</p>

    include some kind of fun Julie illustration here.

  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h2>Contracts</h2>

    <p>Out pizza shop example illustrates comm events nicely, but it isn't very realistic to expect the pizza shop to manually issue a new receive every time an incoming order consumes theirs from the tuplespace.</p>

    include Julie diagram of ordering a pizza tearing down the phone line or destroying the mailbox or something.

    <p>Luckily it's possible to deploy code once, and have it run <em>every</em> time it receives a message. This kind of thing is called a "smart contract". Let's look at some code for a coffee chop that is much superior to the pizza shop.</p>

    include coffeeShop.rho here
  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h2>Your turn</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Order another drink</li>
      <li>Change the acknowledgement message</li>
      <li>The channel is just named <code>@"coffeeShop"</code>. Change it to be named after a specific coffee shop of your choosing.</li>
      <li>Write a similar contract for our pizzaShop. (Don't just copy paste this code. You'll remember the syntax more if you write it yourself.)</li>
    </ul>


  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h2>Persistant For</h2>
    <p>There are actually two dofferent styles of syntax in rholang to acheive this persistent behavior. We just learned about <code>contract</code>. The other option is called a "persistent for". Here is another way to write the coffee shop code.</p>

    include PersistentCoffeeShop.rho

    <p>Notice this is different from a normal for because it has a double arrow <code>&lt;=</code> rather than a single arrow <code>&lt;-</code>. The only difference between the persistent for and a contract comes when we start talking about blockchains. For now you can think of them as the same thing.</p>

    <h2>Quiz</h2>

    <p>Which of these things is not like the other?</p>
    * <code>for (a &lt;- b){}</code>
    * <code>contract b(a) = {}</code>
    * <code>for (a &lt;= b){}</code>

    <p>Which send will produce a comm event with <code>for (message &lt;- @"grandmasSnapChat"){}</code></p>
    * grandmasSnapChat!("Hi Grandma")
    * @"grandmasSnapChat"!("Glad you're snapping Grandma")
    * for("Here's a snap for you g'ma" &lt;- @"grandmasSnapChat")

    <p>Which should generally come first?</p>
    * A send because that's how normal mail works.
    * A receive because it's faster to run the code that way.
    * Either a send of a receive can come first, or they can come together.
    * A receive because rholang is concurrent.
    * Neither. Just make a comm event directly.
