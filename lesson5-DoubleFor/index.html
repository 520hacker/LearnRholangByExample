    <h1>The wrong way</h1>

    <p>You may be tempted to solve this problem by first receiving one then the other.</p>

    <div class="code"></div>

    <p>The problem here is when Alice okay's the launch, but Bob hasn't yet. Alice should be able to change her mind, but she cannot. Imagine if she suddenly noticed a problem and wanted to abort the launch.</p>

    <p>When using a double for, she can still change her mind because the double for won't consume her launch message until bob's message also appears and is ready to be consumed.</p>

    <p>EXERCISE: Write the code that Alice would need to "par in" to retract her launch command.</p>

    <h1>Quiz</h1>

    In <code>for (x &lt;- y; a &lt;- b){ 0 }</code>, which channel must be sent on first?
    y, b, doesn't matter, they must be sent simultaneously.

    In <code>for (x &lt;- y; a &lt;- b){ 0 }</code>, which message will be consumed first?
    y, b, doesn't matter, they will be consumed simultaneously.

    <h1>Exercise -- Patience Game</h1>
    <p>There is a game where two players will each send a message on seperate channels. Whoever sends the first message, loses, and whoever sends the second message wins. Your task here is to write the game code that will tell which player won. To play the game, players should send messages like shown.</p>

  <div class = "slide">
    <h1>Solution -- Patience Game</h1>
    <p>In this case we actually don't want to double for because we care which player went first. Hope I didn't trick you ;)</p>
